My dear Mr. Kappus,
Much time has passed since I received your last letter. Please don’t hold that
against me; first it was work, then a number of interruptions, and finally poor
health that again and again kept me from answering, because I wanted my answer
to come to you out of peaceful and happy days. Now I feel somewhat better again
(the beginning of spring with its moody, bad-tempered transitions was hard to
bear here too) and once again, dear Mr. Kappus, I can greet you and talk to you
(which I do with real pleasure) about this and that in response to your letter, as
well as I can.
You see: I have copied out your sonnet, because I found that it is lovely and
simple born in the shape that it moves in with such quiet decorum. It is the best
poem of yours that you have let me read. And now I am giving you this copy
because I know that it is important and full of new experience to rediscover a
work of one’s own in someone else’s handwriting. Read the poem as if you had
never seen it before, and you will feel in your innermost being how very much it
is your own.
It was a pleasure for me to read this sonnet and your letter, often; I thank you
for both.
And you should not let yourself be confused in your solitude by the fact that
there is something in you that wants to move out of it. This very wish, if you use
it calmly and prudently and like a tool, will help you spread out your solitude
over a great distance. Most people have (with the help of conventions) turned
their solutions toward what is easy and toward the easiest side of the easy; but it is
clear that we must trust in what is difficult; everything alive trusts in it, everything
in Nature grows and defends itself any way it can and is spontaneously
itself, tries to be itself at all costs and against all opposition. We know little, but
that we must trust in what is difficult is a certainty that will never abandon us; it
is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be
one more reason for us to do it.
It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love
another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been
entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all
other work is merely preparation. That is why young people, who are beginners
in everything, are not yet capable of love: it is something they must learn. With
their whole being, with all their forces, gathered around their solitary, anxious,
upward-beating heart, they must learn to love. But learning-time is always a long,
secluded time ahead and far on into life, is—; solitude, a heightened and
deepened kind of aloneness for the person who loves. Loving does not at first
mean merging, surrendering, and uniting with another person (for what would a
union be of two people who are unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent—?),
it is a high inducement for the individual to ripen, to become something in
himself, to become world, to become world in himself for the sake of another
person; it is a great, demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and
calls him to vast distances. Only in this sense, as the task of working on themselves
(“to hearken and to hammer day and night”), may young people use the
love that is given to them. Merging and surrendering and every kind of communion
is not for them (who must still, for a long, long time, save and gather
themselves); it is the ultimate, is perhaps that for which human lives are as yet
barely large enough.
But this is what young people are so often and so disastrously wrong in doing
they (who by their very nature are impatient) fling themselves at each other when
love takes hold of them, they scatter themselves, just as they are, in all their
messiness, disorder, bewilderment. . . . : And what can happen then? What can
life do with this heap of half-broken things that they call their communion and
that they would like to call their happiness, if that were possible, and their future?
And so each of them loses himself for the sake of the other person, and loses the
other, and many others who still wanted to come. And loses the vast distances
and possibilities, gives up the approaching and fleeing of gentle, prescient Things
in exchange for an unfruitful confusion, out of which nothing more can come;
nothing but a bit of disgust, disappointment, and poverty, and the escape into
one of the many conventions that have been put up in great numbers like public
shelters on this most dangerous road. No area of human experience is so extensively
provided with conventions as this one is: there are live-preservers of the most varied invention, boats and water wings; society has been able to create refuges of very sort, for since it preferred to take love-life as an amusement, it also had to give it an easy form, cheap, safe, and sure, as public amusements are. It is true that many young people who love falsely, i.e., simply surrendering themselves and giving up their solitude (the average person will of course always go on doing that — ), feel oppressed by their failure and want to make the situation they have landed in livable and fruitful in their own, personal way —. For their nature tells them that the questions of love, even more than everything else that is important, cannot be resolved publicly and according to this or that agreement; that they are questions, intimate questions from one human being to another, which in any case require a new, special, wholly personal answer —. But how can they, who have already flung themselves together and can no longer tell whose outlines are whose, who thus no longer possess anything of their won, how can they find a way out of themselves, out of the depths of their already buried solitude? They act out of mutual helplessness, and then if, whit the best of intentions, they try to escape the conventions that is approaching them (marriage, for example), they fall into the clutches of some less obvious but just as deadly conventional solution. For then everything around them is — convention. Wherever people act out of a prematurely fused, muddy communion, every action is conventional: every relation that such confusion leads to has its own convention, however unusual (i.e., in the ordinary sense immoral) it may be; even separating would be a conventional step, an impersonal, accidental decision without strength and without fruit. Whoever looks seriously will find that neither for death, which is difficult, nor for difficult love has any clarification, any solution, any hint of a path been perceived; and for both these tasks, which we carry wrapped up and hand on without opening, there is not general, agreed-upon rule that can be discovered. But in the same measure in which we begin to test life as individuals, these great Things will come to meet us, the individuals, with greater intimacy. The claims that the difficult work of love makes upon our development are greater than life, and we, as beginners, are not equal to them. But if we nevertheless endure and take this love upon us as burden and apprenticeship, instead of losing ourselves in the whole easy and frivolous game behind which people have hidden from the solemnity of their being, — then a small advance and a lightening will perhaps be perceptible to those who come long after us. That would be much.
We are only just now beginning to consider the relation of one individual to
a second individual objectively and without prejudice, and our attempts to live
such relationships have no model before them. And yet in the changes that time
has brought about there are already many things that can help our timid novitiate.
The girl and the woman, in their new, individual unfolding, will only in
passing be imitators of male behavior and misbehavior and repeaters of male
professions. After the uncertainty of such transitions, it will become obvious that
women were going through the abundance and variation of those (often ridiculous)
disguises just so that they could purify their own essential nature and wash
out the deforming influences of the other sex. Women, in whom life lingers and
dwells more immediately, more fruitfully, and more confidently, must surely have
become riper and more human in their depths than light, easygoing man, who is
not pulled down beneath the surface of life by the weight of any bodily fruit and
who, arrogant and hasty, undervalues what he thinks he loves. This humanity of
woman, carried in her womb through all her suffering and humiliation, will
come to light when she has stripped off the conventions of mere femaleness in
the transformations of her outward status, and those men who do not yet feel it
approaching will be astonished by it. Someday (and even now, especially in the
countries of northern Europe, trustworthy signs are already speaking and
shining), someday there will be girls and women whose name will no longer
mean the mere opposite of the male, but something in itself, something that
makes one think not of any complement and limit, but only life and reality: the
female human being.
This advance (at first very much against the will of the outdistanced men)
will transform the love experience, which is now filled with error, will change it
from the ground up, and reshape it into a relationship that is meant to be
between one human being and another, no longer one that flows from man to
woman. And this more human love (which will fulfill itself with infinite consideration
and gentleness, and kindness and clarity in binding and releasing) will
resemble what we are now preparing painfully and with great struggle: the love
that consists in this: the two solitudes protect and border and greet each other.
And one more thing: Don’t think that the great love which was once granted to
you, when you were a boy, has been lost; how can you know whether vast and
generous wishes didn’t ripen in you at that time, and purposes by which you are
still living today? I believe that that love remains strong and intense in your
memory because it was your first deep aloneness and the first inner work that
you did on your life. — All good wished to you, dear Mr. Kappus!
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
